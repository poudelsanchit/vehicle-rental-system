# Vehicle Verification System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive vehicle verification system with payment integration between owners and admin, removing the direct payment between users and owners.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added vehicle verification fields:
  - `verificationStatus`: PENDING, ACCEPTED_FOR_PAYMENT, REJECTED, APPROVED
  - `paymentStatus`: UNPAID, PAID, FAILED
  - `verificationFee`: Fixed at NPR 5,000
  - `paymentId`: Khalti payment reference
  - `rejectionReason`: Admin feedback for rejected vehicles
  - `verifiedAt` & `verifiedBy`: Tracking approval details

### 2. Admin Panel (`src/app/admin/vehicles/page.tsx`)
- Complete vehicle verification interface
- View all submitted vehicles with owner details
- Accept/reject vehicles with reason
- Approve vehicles after payment confirmation
- Real-time status updates

### 3. Owner Vehicle Management
- **Verification Status Page** (`src/app/owner/vehicles/verification/page.tsx`)
  - Track verification progress
  - Initiate Khalti payments
  - View rejection reasons
  - Payment retry functionality

- **Payment Success Page** (`src/app/owner/vehicles/payment/success/page.tsx`)
  - Khalti payment verification
  - Success/failure handling
  - Redirect to verification status

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Admin APIs
- `GET /api/v1/admin/vehicles` - Fetch all vehicles for verification
- `PATCH /api/v1/admin/vehicles/[id]/verification` - Update verification status

#### Owner APIs
- `GET /api/v1/owner/vehicles` - Fetch owner's vehicles
- `POST /api/v1/vehicles/[id]/payment` - Initiate Khalti payment
- `POST /api/v1/vehicles/payment/verify` - Verify Khalti payment

### 5. Vehicle Creation Updates
- New vehicles start with `verificationStatus: PENDING`
- Vehicles unavailable until `APPROVED`
- Only approved vehicles show in public listings

### 6. Navigation Updates
- Added "Vehicle Verification" to owner sidebar
- Admin panel includes "Vehicles Verification" section

## Workflow

### For Vehicle Owners:
1. Submit vehicle → Status: PENDING
2. Admin reviews → Status: ACCEPTED_FOR_PAYMENT or REJECTED
3. If accepted, owner pays NPR 5,000 via Khalti
4. After payment → Status: APPROVED
5. Vehicle becomes available for booking

### For Admin:
1. Review submitted vehicles
2. Accept for payment or reject with reason
3. After payment confirmation, approve vehicle
4. Track all verification activities

## Payment Integration
